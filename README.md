# Introduction

This project focuses on using data to better understand real-world phenomena. We work with structured data stored in common formats such as tables or spreadsheets, and use it to extract meaningful insights and support data-driven decisions. The project applies the methods seen in class to explore and visualize data from a real dataset.

# Project goal

The goal is to build a simple visualization prototype based on four indicators extracted from the dataset. The approach follows the main steps of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process.

# Dataset

The dataset is a synthetic invoice dataset generated with the Python Faker library. It mimics data from an online store and contains customer information, transaction details (products, quantities, amounts, dates), and location-related fields.
