# 1. Introduction

Many phenomena can be modeled using computational systems. The modeling process begins by identifying the objects that comprise the overall system.
Next, the attributes or characteristics of objects that simplify reality are described. These objects and their attributes are stored in data repositories such as databases,
data warehouses, data lakes, and spreadsheets. Later, instances of these objects are created, populating the database.
Data is essential for extracting information that improves our understanding of thephenomena under study and informs data-driven decision-making.
In this context, in this nal project, the techniques learned in this course will be used to extract and visualize helpful information from different data sources.

# 2. Project goal  

The aim of this project is to implement a visualization prototype showing four indicators extracted
from the available dataset. The Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process can be used to inspire
the extraction of useful information from a real dataset

 # 3. About the dataset   
 
 The invoice dataset is a synthetic dataset created with the Python Faker library, designed to replicate
 the structure of data typically gathered from an online store. It includes multiple fields such as customer 
 details (first name, last name, email), transaction information (product ID, quantity, amount, invoice date),
 and additional attributes like address, city, and stock code.
